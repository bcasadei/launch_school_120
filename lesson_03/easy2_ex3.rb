# 3. How do you find where Ruby will look for a method when that method is called? 
# How can you find an object's ancestors?
# A: object_name.ancestors

module Taste
  def flavor(flavor)
    puts "#{flavor}"
  end
end

class Orange
  include Taste
end

class HotSauce
  include Taste

# What is the lookup chain for Orange and HotSauce?
p Orange.ancestors # => [Orange, Taste, Object, Kernel, BasicObject]
p HotSauce.ancestors # => [HotSauce, Taste, Object, Kernel, BasicObject]
