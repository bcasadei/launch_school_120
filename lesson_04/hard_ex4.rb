# 4. The designers of the vehicle management system now want to make an adjustment 
# for how the range of vehicles is calculated. 
# For the seaborne vehicles, due to prevailing ocean currents, they want to add an 
# additional 10km of range even if the vehicle is out of fuel.

# Alter the code related to vehicles so that the range for autos and motorcycles 
# is still calculated as before, but for catamarans and motorboats, the range 
# method will return an additional 10km.
