# Given this class:
# class Dog
#   def speak
#     'bark!'
#   end

#   def swim
#     'swimming!'
#   end
# end

# teddy = Dog.new
# puts teddy.speak           # => "bark!"
# puts teddy.swim           # => "swimming!"
# One problem is that we need to track of different breeds of dogs, since they have slightly different behaviors. For example, bulldogs can't swim, but all other dogs can.

# Create a sub-class from Dog called Bulldog overriding the swim method to return "can't swim!"
