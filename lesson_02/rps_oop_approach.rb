Rock, Paper, Scissors is a two-player game where each player 
chooses one of three possible moves: rock, paper, or scissors. 
The chosen moves will then be compared to see who wins, according 
to the following rules:

- rock beats scissors
- scissors beats paper
- paper beats rock

If the players chose the same move, then it is a tie.

Nouns: player, move, rule
Verbs: choose, compare

# Note that we decided to ignore "rock", "paper" or 
# "scissors", since they are all variations on a move 
# -- almost like different states of a move. Therefore, 
# we capture the major noun: move.
